# Pingcoders

Pingcoders is an intra-college programmers profile showcase and community. The app has two different OAuths, `google` and `github` and only the user with college mail id can create an account. It has an email verification system made with `Devise`.

The colours of each language are taken from Github's programming language's colour system. The suggestions are created dynamically by interacting with the GitHub and StackOverflow APIs.

The user can add their projects, experiences, skills and contact information and they can also view other user's projects and skill sets. The user can add any number of projects as an repo belonging to their github account. It also has an `in-app chatting` feature with web sockets support.

You can also add other social media links and profile photo. You can also directly fetch your profile pic from your Github account. Once the user sign in with Github OAuth, their github username will be automatically detected. You can also recruit other people for your project ideas by posting a job. It also supports `markdown` formatting.
